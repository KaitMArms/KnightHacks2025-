The game within this branch was constructed in 36 hours during Knights Hack 2025 by a team of 4 in Unity 6.2. It was designed as a 3D dungeon crawl / fighting game with a host website to enable users to securely download this project. During the course of the hackathon, the general spawn room, male character model, main character walking & jumping animations, and the host website was completed creating the basis for the game in the main branch. This brach is for osterity sake to highlight what this team did in the short time we had as a first time hacker eligible team.
